# Student Allocation System

## Overview
This project saw the creation of a software application in C++ which employs an object oriented design approach to create a login system for students, admins and supervisors to handle the task of project allocation. The application makes use of some software design patterns such as the strategy pattern in an effort to make this code easily extendable.

## User Login
Sample credentials for admins, students and supervisors can be found in the respective csv files in the project code to allow you to log in as a different user base. This approach is by no means secure, but the focus of this project was on the class design for each user base rather than on data security. Some alternative and better approaches would be to use a dedicated SQL database to store the user credentials and a form of data encryption to prevent unauthorised access to the user metadata.

## Project Development
Within the documents folder on the root directory of the project, a UML diagram can be found which illustrates the class design in the program and object relationships. The project report can also be found in this folder, which outlines the development journey and design decisions.
